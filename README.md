# CallKitDemoApp


Build a simple iOS app, that allows just two people to join a video call over data(Wi-Fi or internet).

Your focus should just be on joining two people on a call for video call. 
There will be no need for signup or sign in or homepage. 
Hence it should only be a one screen/page application that simply allows for a video call. 
There should be calling notification available, as in, 
Receiver must be able to accept call from Caller by 'clicking on Accept', 
'Deny' rejecting calls, just like WhatsApp calls. 
Call Notification must be able to hit receiver phone both when it is in foreground and background. 
You are very much allowed to use libraries when you think it will be effective and efficient.
